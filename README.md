# Sui zkLogin demo

![Sui zkLogin demo](https://zklogin-demo.polymedia.app/img/open-graph.png)

A Sui zkLogin end-to-end implementation.

It shows how to use Google/Twitch/Facebook to create a Sui zkLogin address and send a transaction.

The code is meant to be as simple as possible to demonstrate how to put all the pieces together.

The app is live here:
https://zklogin-demo.polymedia.app

Official docs: https://docs.sui.io/concepts/cryptography/zklogin

## OpenID providers

You'll need to create a developer account on Google/Twitch/Facebook. Then, create an "app" from which you can obtain the Client ID to populate your `web/src/config.json`.

Developer consoles: [Google](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard), [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/console), [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).

## Front-end

This is a simple React app. The code is meant to be a tutorial for how to implement
Sui zkLogin, and there are comments that explain the different steps.

All the relevant code is in [web/src/App.tsx](./web/src/App.tsx)

### Local development

Create and modify `config.json`:

```bash
cp web/src/config.example.json web/src/config.json
```

Run the app locally:
```bash
cd web/
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Keep your browser console open so you can see debug and error messages.

## Back-end

### ZK proving service

This app uses the devnet prover that's maintained by Mysten Labs.

Alternatively, you can run your own prover:

### Salt service

This app uses a hard-coded value for the salt so it works out of the box without any further setup.

In production you have a few alternatives:

- You can use the salt service that's maintained by Mysten Labs (you'll have to contact
them to get whitelisted).

- You can ask the user to provide the salt, who must then remember it as if it were a password.

- You can run your own salt service to return a unique salt for each user.
